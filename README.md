# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive full-stack development initiative that replicates the core features of the Airbnb platform. It is designed to provide hands-on experience with backend systems, database modeling, API security, and CI/CD practices. This project simulates real-world software development processes, focusing on collaboration, scalability, and performance.

## Project Goals

- Simulate a production-grade booking platform like Airbnb
- Strengthen backend development skills using Django and MySQL
- Understand and implement secure and scalable RESTful APIs
- Build and document a robust database schema
- Use GitHub collaboratively and effectively
- Deploy code with CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker

## Technology Stack

### Backend:
- **Django** – High-level Python Web framework for rapid development
- **MySQL** – Relational database system to store and manage data
- **GraphQL (optional/advanced)** – For flexible, efficient API querying

### DevOps / Deployment:
- **Docker** – Containerization for consistent development environments
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD automation for building, testing, and deploying code

### Version Control:
- **Git + GitHub** – Collaborative source code management and issue tracking

### Documentation:
- **Markdown** – For project documentation, especially README files
- **GitHub Wiki / Issues** – For planning, tasks, and team coordination
